<h2>A few things about me.</h2>
<li> I am Isha Tariq; a Muslim based in Pakistan. I am an in production developer and a half baked entrepreneur working as a no code automation expert on Upwork(Expertise is up for debate).</li>
<li></li>
<li> I read books, journal more than I take action(which is good?) and prepare for exams in the last 30 days(I am doing it right now).
<h3>What I am doing right now.</h3>
<li> Preparing for exams, work, completing fasts and salat. Also completing five chapters of Quran Translation, finishing who moved my cheeze? and Now or never. And yes completing course-work by a heartbroken dev. </li>
